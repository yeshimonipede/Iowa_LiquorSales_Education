## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
liquor_all <- read.csv("data/Iowa_AllLiquorSales_Education.csv")
head(liquor_all)
summary(liquor_all)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(forecast)
library(car)
```
To assess the relationship between the liquor sales and the education level, prior to organize current variables.
```{r}
liquor1 <- lm(sale.dollars ~ subcategory + item , data = liquor_all)
summary(liquor1)
```
From the first step of doing the regression of the liquor sales on the subcategory of gins, item name, high school graduation and bachelor graduation percent, it's not hard to find several variables are significant than other. For example, in the 'subcategory', the 'American Sloe Gins' shows siginifance. The high school graduation degress and bachelor degree also show relative strong significance on the liquor sales, which will be discussed further. 
```{r}
plot(liquor1,1)
```
```{r}
# the multicollinearity exists or not; the multicollinearity is not a problem here
vif(liquor1)
```
```{r}
# regress liquor sales on other numerical variables
liquor2 <- lm(sale.dollars ~ volume + retail.price, data = liquor_all)
summary(liquor2)
```
```{r}
plot(liquor2,1)
```
```{r}
#filter a specific county to see if the regression is 
liquor_benton <- filter(liquor_all, county =="Benton")
liquor_johnson <- filter(liquor_all,county =="Johnson")
```
Based on the regression of liquor sales on different variables, filter specific counties to see whether the significant difference changes.
```{r}
Johnson <- glm(sale.dollars ~ subcategory + item + retail.price + volume, data = liquor_johnson)
summary(Johnson)
```
```{r}
benton <- glm(sale.dollars ~ subcategory + item + retail.price + volume, data = liquor_benton)
summary(benton)
```
```{r}
#only include the educational factors: 
liquor_education <- lm(data = liquor_all, sale.dollars ~ High.school.graduate.or.higher + Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)
summary(liquor_education)
plot(liquor_education)
```
By selecting two seperate counties, we could feature some changes between the subcategory and specific item influences on the sales of liquor.
What if doing the t-test to find higher/lower education level? 
```{r}
library(stats)
as.numeric(liquor_all$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)
# Filter the dataset based on educational level 
high_bachelor <- liquor_all[liquor_all$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher  > 0.2,]
low_bachelor <- liquor_all[liquor_all$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher < 0.2,]


high_bachelor_mean <- mean(high_bachelor$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)
high_bachelor_mean<- sd(high_bachelor$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)

low_bachelor_mean <- mean(low_bachelor$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)
low_bachelor_sd <- sd(low_bachelor$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)

# Perform t-test to test significance of mpg between the two groups
t_test_result <- t.test(high_bachelor$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher, low_bachelor$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher)

cat("Mean bachelor percent for high bachelor group:", high_bachelor_mean, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation of bachelor for high bachelor group:", high_bachelor_mean, "\n")
cat("\n")
cat("Mean bachelor percent for low bachelor group:", low_bachelor_mean, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation of bachelor for low bachelor group:", low_bachelor_sd, "\n")
cat("\n")
cat("T-test results:\n")
print(t_test_result)

```
k-means clustering
```{r}
#set ggplot 
ggplot(liquor_benton, aes(retail.price,sale.dollars, color = subcategory)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
    xlab("retail price of liquor ") +
    ylab("total liquor sales")
```
```{r}
benton_2cols <- liquor_benton %>% select(sale.dollars, retail.price) %>% scale()
km.out <- kmeans(benton_2cols, centers = 3, nstart = 20)
km.out
```
there are three clusters has been built at size of 88,95 and 290,each observation will be assigned to one of the three clusters. However, we need to try different numbers of k to track if current numbers of clusters are reasonable.
```{r}
#the checking-procedure of numbers of clusters
install.packages("factoextra",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(factoextra)
```
```{r}
#elbow method 
fviz_nbclust(benton_2cols,kmeans,method = "wss") + geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2) +
labs(subtitle = "Elbow method")
```
Above the graph, we know how the total within-cluster sum of squares decreases as the number of clusters grows. 
```{r}
#silhouette method
fviz_nbclust(benton_2cols,kmeans,method = "silhouette")
```
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(benton_2cols, kmeans, nstart = 25,  method = "gap_stat", nboot = 50)+
  labs(subtitle = "Gap statistic method")
```
based on three methods to find optimal numbers of clusters, the gap statistic providing a statistical procedure to formalize the elbow/silhouette methods. if we choose 4 as the clusters:
```{r}
km.out <- kmeans(benton_2cols, centers = 4, nstart = 20)
km.out
```
```{r}
liquor_benton$cluster_id <- factor(km.out$cluster)
ggplot(liquor_benton, aes(retail.price, sale.dollars, color = cluster_id)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
    xlab("retail price") +
    ylab("Price")
```
change another dimension on the specific county: Johnson,still doing the k clustering
```{r}
johnson_2cols <- liquor_johnson %>% select(sale.dollars, retail.price) %>% scale()
km.out <- kmeans(johnson_2cols, centers = 2, nstart = 50)
km.out
```
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(johnson_2cols,kmeans,method = "wss") + geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2) +
labs(subtitle = "Elbow method")
```
same checking process as the county'benton'
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(johnson_2cols,kmeans,method = "silhouette")
```
```{r}
#change the number of clusters
km.out <- kmeans(johnson_2cols, centers = 4, nstart = 50)
km.out
```
```{r}
liquor_johnson$cluster_id <- factor(km.out$cluster)
ggplot(liquor_johnson, aes(retail.price, sale.dollars, color = cluster_id)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
    xlab("retail price") +
    ylab("Price")
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset based on educational level 
high_bachelor <- liquor_all[liquor_all$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher > 0.2,]
low_bachelor <- liquor_all[liquor_all$Bachelor.s.degree.or.higher < 0.2,]

# Perform t-test to test significance of liquor sales between the two groups
t_test_result_bach <- t.test(high_bachelor$sale.volume, low_bachelor$sale.volume)
print(t_test_result_bach)

high_hs <- liquor_all[liquor_all$High.school.graduate.or.higher > 0.9,]
low_hs <- liquor_all[liquor_all$High.school.graduate.or.higher < 0.9,]

t_test_hs <- t.test(high_hs$sale.volume, low_hs$sale.volume)

# Print the results
print(t_test_hs)

```
